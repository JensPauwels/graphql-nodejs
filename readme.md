# - GraphQL in NodeJS

This project is an example how to implement GraphQL in NodeJS.
In the future I'll add JWT authentication with refresh tokens and perhaps a real databse.


#### Start development:
  `yarn start:dev`

#### Build the project:
  `yarn build`


#### Start the docker container with live reloading:
  `docker-compose up`
